       She was admitted to the clinic for urgent indications with complaints of dull diffuse headache,
  dizziness, rise in blood pressure to 170/100 mm Hg, chest discomfort with irradiation to the left arm
  with slight physical exertion, shortness of breath, palpitations; heartburn, belching sour, nausea,
  vomiting; soreness in the shoulder, knee, ankle, small joints of the hands and feet, itching of the skin
  of the face, hands, forearms, hyperemia of the back and wings of the nose, swelling of the face in the
  morning; weight gain, general weakness; internal discomfort and feeling of lack of air mainly at night;
  dull aching pain in the lumbar region.

        Anamnesis morbi: She fell ill acutely in November 2005, when, against the background of relative
  well-being, severe morning stiffness, soreness, redness and swelling appeared in the area of small
  joints of both hands, shoulder, elbow and knee joints, fever up to 400C, sweating, severe general
  weakness pain, fast fatigue. On November 14, she was examined by a general practitioner, and a
  course of anti-inflammatory therapy (diclofenac retard, prednisone 30 mg/day) was prescribed, which
  resulted in a significant improvement in her state of health. In view of the deterioration of her condition
  in January 2006, she was hospitalized at military unit 25515 with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis,
  seropositive, articular form. She received cytostatic therapy with methotrexate, mini-pulse therapy
  with methylprednisolone, movalis, physiotherapy with a positive effect. Further, against the background
  of outpatient cytostatic therapy (methotrexate 7.5 mg/week, predn isolon 10 mg/day) for the next three
  months felt satisfactorily. In May 2006, against the background of constant use of methotrexate,
  prednisolone and bathing, pain, heaviness in the epigastric region and nausea after taking medications,
  in the left and right hypochondria appeared, and therefore she independently refused to take
  medications. Against the background of refusal of treatment, pain in the joints intensified, pains in the
  right elbow joint joined, subfibrile fever appeared. She resumed taking medications again without a
  positive effect. 26.06.06 For urgent indications, she was hospitalized in the rheumatology department
  of the Medical Unit of OAO NLMK, where she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus for
  the first time. She received treatment: methotrexate 10 mg/week, prednisolone 20 mg/day, movalis,
  chimes, pentoxifylline, physiotherapy with a positive effect. However, against the background of
  constant intake of these drugs, at the end of October 2006, pain in the joints increased again,
  hyperemia of the back of the nose and cheeks appeared, itching of the skin of the face, hands, swelling
  on the face and hands, periodic pain behind the sternum and in the left half of the chest, palpitations ,
  shortness of breath with little physical exertion, general weakness, pain in the mouth, aching pain in
  the lumbar region after physical exertion and a decrease in the dose of prednisolone taken a. Stationary
  held a course of plasmapheresis and plasmasorption, pulse therapy with methylprednisolone. After
  this course of therapy for the next 6 months, while taking 10 mg of prednisolone and 7.5 mg of
  methotrexate, she felt well. Exacerbations of the disease were noted in October-November 2007 and
  February-March 2007 and 2008, however, an increase in the dose of prednisolone to 80 mg/day for 3
  weeks, followed by a gradual decrease in the dose to 15-40 mg/day, made it possible to stop
   exacerbations. Annually, she underwent planned inpatient treatment for the underlying disease, where
  the dose of the drugs taken was adjusted. The last exacerbation of the disease was noted in September
   2008. In the day hospital regime, the following treatment was carried out: regimen, diet, intravenous
  injection: pulse therapy "Solu-medrol" 1000 mg (18.09.08 and 19.09.2008), asparkam, cardionat,
  cytoflavin and Riboxin No. 5, Neoton 4g No. 2, Vitamins: C, B1, Trental No. 3, Cerebrolysis No. 1,
  Piracetam No. 3, Prednisolone 40 mg in the morning, Methotrexate 10 mg / week. After the therapy, a
  short-term improvement in well-being was noted, however, from mid-October, the condition
  progressively worsened in the form of discomfort behind the sternum with irradiation to the left arm
  and shortness of breath with little physical exertion (rise to the 1st floor), palpitations, heartburn, sour
  belching, nausea , pain in the shoulder, knee, ankle, small joints of the hands, feet, swelling of the face
  in the morning, general weakness, internal discomfort and itching of the skin of the face, forearms,
  hands, as well as a feeling of lack of air mainly at night, hyperemia back and wings of the nose.
  Increasing the dose of methotrexate taken up to 15 mg/week and prednisolone up to 40 mg/day did
  not lead to the desired result. The existing complaints, despite the intake of omeprazole and almagel
  for the purpose of gastroprotection, were joined by pain in the epigastric region, heartburn, sour
  belching, nausea, episodic vomiting after taking medications, progressively increasing general
  weakness, numbness in the fingers and toes. On an outpatient basis in the polyclinic in the general
   blood test, signs of a mild degree of normochromic anemia were revealed, laboratory data for the
  activity of the process (increased ESR, CRP) were not noted, and therefore hospitalization in the rheumatolo

   oliprel 2mg in the morning). For the first time, systolic murmur over the apex of the heart appeared in 2006,
  with time its intensity increased. Episodic pain in the epigastric region notes for ten years, was treated
  independently with a temporary positive effect. Over the past two years, sh
   stiffness when walking, numbness in the fingers of the upper limbs, not treated, no medical help

    greeted.

   Around 5:00 on November 17, 2008. I woke up with an unbearable headache and nausea. There was a single vomiting
  food eaten the day before. Given the increase in blood pressure to 170/100 mm Hg. self-administered captopri
  l 50 mg p / i, nifedipine 10 mg p / i without effect. Given the appearance of flies flickering before the eyes, the expressi
  the heaviness in the head, nausea, weakness caused an ambulance. Delivered to wedge

   Technical commentary on the study 11/15/2006: Antibodies to the
   common extractable nuclear antigen of antibodies to SS-A antigen 60 kDa were found Antit
   ate to Ro / SS-A antigen with a mass of 60 kDa are relatively more often detected in patients with SLE than in patients with III syndrome
   ogren and skin forms. Antibodies to the 60 kDa Ro/SS-A antigen are relatively more frequently detected in more
   ny SLE than in Sjogren's syndrome and cutaneous primary skin lesions, secondary dry syndrome, photosensitivity and articular
   syndrome. A dangerous manifestation of SLE associated with ant
   antibodies against Ro / SS-A 60 kDa, is a syndrome of congenital lupus that develops in newborns
    from women in labor with SLE. The basis of this disease is the penetration into the blood of a newborn
   placenta anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies. The main manifestation of congenital lupus is dermatosis and lesions.
   internal organs, including congenital transverse AV block, hepatitis, hemolytic anemia
   and thrombocytopenia. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are the main serological marker of SLE with lesions
   m of the kidneys, since they are involved in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis, in addition, they are included in the 10th criterion of SLE.
   low titers of antibodies to DNA without concomitant ANF and antibodies to an extractable nuclear antigen can be observed
   against the background of viral and infectious diseases and are not detected in isolated detection.
   are a sign of SLE. There is a relationship between the increase in titers of antinuclear factor (AN
   F), antibodies to dsDNA and hypocomplementemia before the development of an exacerbation of SLE, which requires periodic
   determination of antibody titers to dsDNA and the level of complement factors C3 and C4 in all SLE patients with frequencies
   oh once every 3-6 months.

  day - 83 beats / min (min. -57, max. -151), average during night sleep - 96 beats / min (min. -51, max.
  -186) . In general, the dynamics of heart rate without features, the decrease at night is within the normal
  range. Against the background of sinus rhythm, which continued throughout the entire period of
  observation, the following types of arrhythmias were registered: I. solitary supraventricular extrasystole
  with a pre-ectopic interval from 421 to 882 (mean-570) msec; in total ­ 2, II. Paroxysm of atrial fibrillation-
  flutter (AF) with a heart rate of 121 beats/min., once a day at 23:04, subjectively manifested by a sharp
  attack of dizziness. Episodes of ST segment depression up to -1.8 mm, in leads characterizing the
  potentials of the anterior wall, lateral wall of the left ventricle, painless, occurring at the height of physical
  activity with different threshold heart rate >160 beats/min; stresses characteristic of angina pectoris 1

   about 6000 ml of hemorrhagic exudate was recovered, a drop in hemoglobin level from 144 to 80 g/l was noted, which
   served as a reason for transfer to a surgical hospital, where data for ongoing intrapleural
   no bleeding was obtained, she received conservative therapy, therapy with terilitin. Discharged with subfebrile
   fever. Due to the deterioration of health in May 2012 in the form of severe fever

   Disease history:
          She fell ill acutely in November 2005, when, against the background of relative well-being, severe morning stiffness,

   soreness, redness and swelling appeared in the area of small joints of both hands, shoulder, elbow and knee joints, fever up
   to 400C, sweating, severe general weakness, rapid
   languor. On November 14, she was examined by a general practitioner, a course of anti-inflammatory therapy was prescribed (d
   ofenak-retard, prednisolone 30 mg/day) against which there was a significant improvement in well-being.

   She underwent inpatient treatment at military unit 25515 with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, seropositive, articular
   i form. Received cytostatic therapy, mini-pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, movalis
   , physiotherapy with a positive effect. In the future, against the background of outpatient cytostatic
   th therapy (methotrexate 7.5 mg/week, prednisone 10 mg/day), pain appeared, heaviness in the epigastrium, left and right
   right hypochondrium, in connection with which in May 2006 she independently refused to take medication
   rats. Against the background of refusal of treatment, pain in the joints intensified, pain in the right elbow joint joined
   ve. She resumed taking medications again without a positive effect.
         26.06.06 was hospitalized in the rheumatology department of the medical unit of NLMK OJSC, where for the first time
   A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus was made. Received treatment: methotrexate 10 mg/week, prednisolone 20 m
   /day, movalis, chimes, pentoxifylline, physiotherapy with a positive effect. However, against the backdrop of
   After taking these drugs at the end of October 2006, pain in the joints increased again,

     hyperemia of the back of the nose and cheeks, itching of the skin of the face, swelling on the face and hands, recurrent pain behind the sternum and in the

   in the upper half of the chest, palpitations, shortness of breath with little physical exertion, general weak
   st, sore throat, pain in the lumbar region during exercise.

         In 2008, 2009 she underwent inpatient treatment using efferent therapy methods according to
   a gadfly of repeated exacerbations of systemic lupus erythematosus with a moderate

         effect. Over the past three years, he has noted an increase in blood pressure up to 170/110 mm Hg, accompanied by
   expectant dizziness, nausea, palpitations. From the same time - unsteadiness when walking, numbness

   in the fingers of the upper limbs.

         In May 2010, she underwent inpatient treatment for progressive angina pectoris. During n
   The following year, attacks of stable angina pectoris, characteristic of level 2 FC, were noted. episodic
   Ski noted attacks of palpitations predominantly at night lasting up to 20 minutes;

    taken on their own.

         Episodic pain in the epigastric region has been noted for ten years, was treated independently, taking a large
   number of antisecretory and antacid drugs, with a temporary positive effect
   volume. On December 22, 2010, laparoscopic surgery was performed to eliminate the infringement
   paraesophageal hernia repair (laparoscopic posterior cruroraphy, Nissen-Rosetti fundoplication. K 44.9). At the time
   of hospitalization, he regularly takes: Prednisone 5 mg - 2 tab. in the morning with breakfast until 9 a.m.

   tra--constantly; Methotrexate 2.5 mg - 1 tab. 3 times a week (Saturday morning and evening 1 tab, Sunday
   in the morning 1 tab.) - constantly; Sorbifer durules - 1 capsule in the morning; Movalis - 1 candle in the morning at about
   acute articular syndrome; Concor-core - 1 tab. in the morning. Real

          deterioration: on 05/09/2011, at about 9 o'clock in the morning, I woke up from pressing pain in the left half
   no chest, pronounced palpitations, significant general weakness. Independently accepted the entire list
    medications taken without effect. Given the ineffectiveness of self-treatment, in
   called an ambulance, which was taken to the hospital therapy clinic for
    diagnosis and treatment with a diagnosis of "newly diagnosed paroxysm of atrial fibrillation".

         Objective status at admission: Height 164 cm, body weight at admission 64 kg. The general condition is severe,
   due to signs of electrical instability of the myocardium, arrhythmogenic shock. Laid
   not passive. Satisfactory nutrition: BMI 24.4 kg/m2. The skin in the "décolleté" area is hyperpigmented
   , ecchymosis on the skin of the face, chest, abdomen, limbs. Peripheral (submandibular, maxillary, neck
   axillary) lymph nodes are moderately enlarged, painless on palpation, not soldered to the environment
   stretching fabrics. Movements in the joints are not limited, in the ankle, knee and small joints of the hands
   moderately painful, edematous. On palpation of the radial arteries, the pulse is asynchronous, the same on both
   hands, rhythmic, with a frequency of 158 beats. per minute, weak filling, uniform, low tension, palpi
   the vascular wall is cut outside the pulse wave. The monitor registers supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate
   of 158/min. SatO2=92%. Blood pressure: on the right shoulder - 80/60, on the left shoulder - 80/60 mm Hg. with
   m. Limits of relative cardiac dullness: right and upper are normal; left - on the left mid-clavicular
   line. The heart sounds are muffled, the 1st tone is weakened above the apex of the heart, the systolic murmur is at the apex.
   Respiration rate 24 per minute. On auscultation over the lungs, breathing is hard, multiple
   th congestive rales in the lower lobes of both lungs. The abdomen is soft and painless. The size of the liver according to Ku
   fishing 10x9x7 cm. Tapping on the lumbar region is painless.

        As a result of the treatment: According to vital indications at 11:45 on 05/09/2011, taking into account the significant

  hemodynamic significance of tachycardia paroxysm, transthoracic electric cardio
  diversion - restored sinus rhythm.
      Regime, diet No. 10, metabolic, hypotensive, antianginal, antiarrhythmic, vascular therapy

  y, shortness of breath and discomfort in the left half of the chest with moderate physical exertion, periodically
  ki headaches mainly in the occipital region against the background of an increase in blood pressure
  up to 180/115 mm Hg, weight gain.

       History of the disease: considers himself ill since 1999, when he first noted the appearance of a headache
  and against the background of an increase in blood pressure to 160/110 mm Hg. Not treated. In 2003 at the hospital
  On examination, hypertension of the second stage was diagnosed. The maximum numbers of blood pressure 220 /
   120 mmHg He took enalapril, amlodipine with a temporary positive effect. I have been ill since 2008
  The situation has acquired a crisis character with an episode of transient ischemic attack in the LCMA basin (30.11.

      History of present illness. In 2012, due to the frequent detection of elevated arterial yes
phenomenon, its lability, headaches was inpatient treatment in the clinic of military field therapy
and (a copy of case history #56606 is pasted into this case history). During the patient's hospitalization

onary arteries, CHF 1 fc, chronic calculous cholecystitis, remission, thoracic osteochondrosis
la with muscular-tonic syndrome, obesity of the third degree. Regularly takes amlodipine, Valsart
an + hypothiazide, plavix with a positive effect.

      Over the past year, I began to notice the frequent appearance of discomfort in the lower part of the chest on both sid

   toron, more on the left. Since the beginning of October, after physical exertion (ascent to the 5th floor), attacks appeared

        October 24, 2013: sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 73/min. Normal position of the EOS. Incomplete blockade
   the right leg of the bundle of His. The predominance of the potentials of the left ventricle. Violation of repolarization processe
    in the area of the bottom wall.
        Spirometry dated 25.10.2013 The coefficient of bronchodilation was 6.77%, which is regarded as fi
   physiological variability of the bronchial lumen.

they.

     History of present illness. She suffered from chronic bronchitis for a long time. fell ill in 2011
the disease acquired a protracted course with frequent bouts of dyspnea, which required active treatment for
medical help. Bronchial asthma was verified on a stationary basis, adequate therapy was selected for outpatient
admission (Seretide-multidisc 50/250 1 dose 1 time per day and berodual 2 doses 2 times a day). AT
the same year she was operated on for urolithiasis on both sides, the stones were removed. In after

during the operating period, she began to notice a significant increase in blood pressure, mainly

due to diastolic, palpitations, weakness, weight began to progressively increase (during the last 2 years, body
weight has been stable). Takes diltiazem without visible effect.

    As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 7, Seretide-multidisc, Berodual, Acecardol, Amlod
ipin, omeprazole, furosemide, ciprofloxacin, the state of health has improved.

     The patient was consulted by Professor Barsukov A.V. It was determined that at present the course of
concomitant diseases is of the maximum possible compensated character. The severity of the condition
I and the prognosis determine the functional state of the excretory function of the kidneys and the existing neoplasm
adrenal glands, which make a significant contribution to the maintenance of arterial hypertension,
sheniya heart rhythm, the defeat of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Despite the convincing effect of the prescribed
therapy, it is recommended to recommend the patient an additional examination on an outpatient basis in order to determin

of the adrenal glands, performing a blood test for catecholamines, plasma renin activity cr

ovi, aldosterone level (after discontinuation of drugs that affect the RAAS system for 14 days) followed by
consultation with a nephrologist.

Surgical treatment for bleeding (shock 2-3) from a chronic stomach ulcer was completed. During that
same hospitalization revealed decompensated diabetes mellitus. After discharge, she did not comply with the
doctor's recommendations, she began to notice an increase in the volume of the abdomen. He was hospitalized several tim
es to the hospitals of the city, where complex treatment with active diuretic therapy was performed. Last
I am hospitalized in the pulmonology department of City Hospital No. 26. after discharge from the hospital, the condition is sharply w
suffocated. She was admitted to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications. Objective status:

  edema in the legs, ascites, right-sided hydrothorax persists, manifestations of heart failure have decreased

    residuals.

  Taking into account the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy

   and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, as well as given the one-sidedness of the

  ota (right pleural cavity), in further diagnosis, exclude a neoplasm of the right lung, with
  redostium, abdominal organs.

in the lower lobe of the left lung, severe, left-sided effusion pleurisy. Cholelithiasis
, chronic calculous cholecystitis, remission. Obesity I degree, alimentary-constitutional type, stable phase. fatty
hepatosis. A disability certificate was not issued. Employability has not been restored. Clinical outcome (underline):
improvement Outcome: discharged due to improvement Admission: Complaints: pressing pain in the heart area
during exercise; shortness of breath of an inspiratory nature; with

   ear cough without phlegm; an increase in body temperature up to 39 degrees; weakness.
        Anamnesis of the disease: He considers himself ill since the beginning of March 2011, when, against the background of hypo
   these complaints were received. He did not seek medical help, periodically took Biseptol, Amox
   icillin. In connection with persistent complaints, he sought medical help at the clinic on 03/17/20
   11, ECG revealed atrial fibrillation, radiograph focal pneumonia. hospitalized
    by ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic.
         Objective status: general condition is severe, no edema, heart rate 76 per minute, rhythmic, auscultatory t

   The heart sounds are muffled, the accent of the second tone is above the aorta, the borders of the heart are expanded to the left, BP is 110/70 mm

   t.st., hard breathing in the lungs, no wheezing; the abdomen is soft, painless on palpation, effleurage
    in the lumbar region painlessly on both sides. As a result of

        the treatment: mode III, diet No. 10, antibiotic therapy (Ceftriaxone 1.0 2 r / day), polarizing mixture (glucose 5%,
   potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate., Vit. C 6 ml - No. 5), metabolic
   anti-inflammatory therapy (Mildronate), antisecretory therapy (omeprazole), anti-inflammatory therapy (Ibuprofe
   n 0.4 3 r / day), GCS therapy (Prednisolone IV 90 mg 3 r / d), antiarrhythmic therapy (Cordaron 0.2 3 r / d)
   , anticoagulant therapy (Heparin s / c at 2500 4 r / d) the state of health improved in the form of a decrease in shortness of breath
   and, the degree of severity in the region of the heart, the divergence of the sheets of the pericardium decreased.

   Results of instrumental studies:

  genesis of pronounced congestion was determined, therapy was selected for the initial stage a
  outpatient treatment. In a satisfactory condition, he is discharged to the polyclinic at the place of residence
  under the supervision of specialist doctors.

  Recommended:
    15. Lifelong dispensary observation of a nephrologist, endocrinologist, cardiologist at the place of residence.
    16. Control study (at least 1 time in 3 months): ECG, general blood and urine analysis, blood test for
   the content of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, creatinine, potassium, urea, glucose. 17.
    Determination of blood levels of T3, T4, antibodies to thyroglobulin, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone - 2
  times a year, followed by correction based on the results of the dose of levothyroxine 18. Continuous
    monitoring of body weight !!! with an increase in body weight of more than 1 kg (in comparison with data in
  discharges) consultation of a cardiologist in order to exclude the worsening of the course of chronic heart failure
   accuracy and correction (if necessary) of the therapy. 19. Diet:
    limiting the intake of protein with food to up to 0.8-1 g / kg (up to 50-60 g per day), depending on you
  severity of renal failure. At the same time, 30 g should be a highly valuable protein, and the share of chl
   Eba, cereals, potatoes and other vegetables should account for only 10 g of protein per day. 30-40 g of complete prote
  ka. In general, the patient's menu is compiled within table No. 7. The following are included in the patient's daily diet:
  blowing products: meat (100-120 g), curd dishes, cereal dishes, semolina porridge, rice, buckwheat, p
   earl. A potato and potato-egg diet is recommended. Particularly suitable due to the slight
   spruce protein content and at the same time high energy value of potato dishes (fritters,
   otlety, babki, fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, etc.), salads with sour cream, vinaigrettes with a significant
  th amount (50-100 g) of vegetable oil. Tea or coffee can be acidified with lemon, put 2-3 tablespoons
  and sugar per glass, it is recommended to use honey, jam, jam. Thus, the main composition of food is
  carbohydrates and fats and dosed - proteins. Calculating the daily amount of protein in the diet is a must.
  telny. It is allowed to replace 1 egg with: cottage cheese - 40 g; meat - 35 g; fish - 50 g; milk - 160 g; cheese - 2

   0 g; beef liver - 40 g. Approximate

    compacted. The myocardium is slightly eccentrically hypertrophied. The cavities of the heart are free, not expanded
   irens. Global LV systolic function was preserved. Zones of local violation of contractility were not detected
   lazy. Type I diastolic dysfunction. The valves are intact. At dopplerographic research patol
   ogy was not detected. Pericardium without features.
         24-hour monitoring ECG monitoring according to Holter dated September 23, 2014: during the observation period, I recorded
   sinus rhythm with heart rate from 63 to 130 per 1 minute, the decrease in heart rate at night is insufficient. Average heart rate 78/8
   /70 in 1 minute. Single supraventricular extrasystoles were registered (23 in total). When performing the planned load, the
   heart rate reached 130 and 123 in 1 minute, while the patient noted ischemic dizziness.

   There were no significant changes in the ST segment.

   t. st. at night. Mean systolic blood pressure during the daytime is characteristic of mild labile hypertension, in n
   Full-time BP is characteristic of mild stable hypertension. At night, systolic and diastolic A
   D decrease insufficiently (nondipper). Episodes of hypotension were not registered.

        X-ray of the chest organs No. 859 dated September 22, 2014: in the lungs without focal and infiltrative
   x changes. The roots of the lungs are fibrously compacted, not expanded. Heart - aortic configuration due to the enlarged
   left ventricle. The aorta is enlarged and thickened. Spirometry dated 09/25/2014: VFL within normal limits. Spirometry (test

         with bronchodilator) from 09/25/2014: test with salbutamol: bronchodil coefficient

   tion was 1.6%, which corresponds to the physiological variability of the bronchial lumen.
         Fibrocolonoscopy dated 09/24/14: perianal skin is not changed. On digital examination, tone with

   rectal finkter is normal. In the anus, collapsed hemorrhoids are determined and moderate
   but tense internal haemorrhoids with inflamed mucosa over them. The distal end of the fibrocolonoscope is inserted into
   the rectum, where 2 on a wide base are determined in the ampulla
   and a diameter of 0.3-0.4 cm hyperplastic polyp. At 15 cm in the upper ampullar region, half-dip on a narrow axis
   0.5 cm in diameter. In the distal part of the sigmoid colon (23-25 cm) there is a polyp on a long stalk 2.0

Disease history. Suffer from coronary heart disease, hypertension for a long time
Yu. I have been drinking alcohol for a long time. In 2004, she suffered a massive myocardial infarction. 17.10.10 you
Surgical treatment for bleeding (shock 2-3) from a chronic stomach ulcer was completed. During the same
hospitalization, decompensated diabetes mellitus was diagnosed. After discharge, the doctor's recommendation is no
observed, began to notice an increase in the volume of the abdomen. She was hospitalized several times for this reas
go to the hospitals of the city, where complex treatment with active diuretic therapy was carried out. After issue
claims from the pulmonology department of City Hospital No. 26, his condition deteriorated sharply. From 23.12.10 to 14.01.11 pas

  she was treated at the GT VMedA clinic. In view of the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural
  th cavity to diuretic therapy and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, in dia
  Gnostic patient was recommended to perform a CT scan in order to exclude a neoplasm of the right leg
  whom, mediastinum, abdominal organs. When trying to perform a tomography, the study turned out to be
  b uninformative, according to the patient, due to the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity. During the
  Last week, she began to notice an increase in dyspnea, its occurrence at rest. In this connection, she was
   taken by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications Objective status: general condition
   of moderate severity, swelling of the feet, legs, heart rate 90 per minute, deficiency
   it is not, the pulse is rhythmic, auscultatory heart sounds are muffled, the 1st tone is weakened above the apex of the
   heart, there is a coarse systolic murmur at the apex, the borders of the heart are expanded, blood pressure is 110/60

  a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 9, metabolic therapy (polarizing mixture: Sol.N
   aCl 0.9%-200.0, Sol.Asparcami 20 ml), inotropic therapy (Korglikon 0.06% 1.0 IV drip, Digoxin 0.00

   025 2 tab. in the morning), beta-adrenolytics (Betaloc-Zok 0.05 to 0.25 tab. 2 times a day), antithrombotic
  rapia (Acecardol 0.1, 1 tab. 1 time per day), hepatoprotective therapy (Essentiale 5.0 No. 5 IV), punctures of
  the right pleural cavity (January 27, 31, February 7 with evacuation of 2700 ml, 1500 ml, 2000 ml straw w
   yellow liquid, subsequent administration of 80 mg of gentamicin intrapleurally) the state of health improved, about
  shortness of breath decreased, cough regressed, swelling on the legs disappeared, a small amount of fluid remained
  bones in the supraphrenic portions of the right lung.
       Taking into account the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy
   apia and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, as well as given the unilateral effusion (right
  pleural cavity), further diagnosis should still exclude a neoplasm
  diagnostic (pleural
       mesothelioma?) Performing diagnostic videothoracoscopy was inappropriate for the patient, since this ma
  nipulation requires one-lung ventilation of the lungs - a patient with functional disorders
  m this intervention will not endure.
       Data for tuberculosis were not received.

       This block includes a number of mental disorders grouped together in relation to the presence of
  other etiological factors, namely, the cause of these disorders were brain diseases, injuries
  a brain or stroke leading to cerebral dysfunction. Dysfunction may be primary (to

  brain) and secondary (as in systemic diseases or disorders where the brain is involved
  I am in the pathological process along with other organs and systems).

       Dementia [dementia] (F00-F03) is a syndrome caused by damage to the brain (usually chronic
  of a progressive or progressive nature), in which many higher cortical functions are disturbed, including

       She was admitted to the clinic for urgent indications with complaints of dull diffuse headache,
  dizziness, rise in blood pressure to 170/100 mm Hg, chest discomfort with irradiation to the left arm
  with slight physical exertion, shortness of breath, palpitations; heartburn, belching sour, nausea,
  vomiting; soreness in the shoulder, knee, ankle, small joints of the hands and feet, itching of the skin
  of the face, hands, forearms, hyperemia of the back and wings of the nose, swelling of the face in the
  morning; weight gain, general weakness; internal discomfort and feeling of lack of air mainly at night;
  dull aching pain in the lumbar region.

        Anamnesis morbi: She fell ill acutely in November 2005, when, against the background of relative
  well-being, severe morning stiffness, soreness, redness and swelling appeared in the area of small
  joints of both hands, shoulder, elbow and knee joints, fever up to 400C, sweating, severe general
  weakness pain, fast fatigue. On November 14, she was examined by a general practitioner, and a
  course of anti-inflammatory therapy (diclofenac retard, prednisone 30 mg/day) was prescribed, which
  resulted in a significant improvement in her state of health. In view of the deterioration of her condition
  in January 2006, she was hospitalized at military unit 25515 with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis,
  seropositive, articular form. She received cytostatic therapy with methotrexate, mini-pulse therapy
  with methylprednisolone, movalis, physiotherapy with a positive effect. Further, against the background
  of outpatient cytostatic therapy (methotrexate 7.5 mg/week, predn isolon 10 mg/day) for the next three
  months felt satisfactorily. In May 2006, against the background of constant use of methotrexate,
  prednisolone and bathing, pain, heaviness in the epigastric region and nausea after taking medications,
  in the left and right hypochondria appeared, and therefore she independently refused to take
  medications. Against the background of refusal of treatment, pain in the joints intensified, pains in the
  right elbow joint joined, subfibrile fever appeared. She resumed taking medications again without a
  positive effect. 26.06.06 For urgent indications, she was hospitalized in the rheumatology department
  of the Medical Unit of OAO NLMK, where she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus for
  the first time. She received treatment: methotrexate 10 mg/week, prednisolone 20 mg/day, movalis,
  chimes, pentoxifylline, physiotherapy with a positive effect. However, against the background of
  constant intake of these drugs, at the end of October 2006, pain in the joints increased again,
  hyperemia of the back of the nose and cheeks appeared, itching of the skin of the face, hands, swelling
  on the face and hands, periodic pain behind the sternum and in the left half of the chest, palpitations ,
  shortness of breath with little physical exertion, general weakness, pain in the mouth, aching pain in
  the lumbar region after physical exertion and a decrease in the dose of prednisolone taken a. Stationary
  held a course of plasmapheresis and plasmasorption, pulse therapy with methylprednisolone. After
  this course of therapy for the next 6 months, while taking 10 mg of prednisolone and 7.5 mg of
  methotrexate, she felt well. Exacerbations of the disease were noted in October-November 2007 and
  February-March 2007 and 2008, however, an increase in the dose of prednisolone to 80 mg/day for 3
  weeks, followed by a gradual decrease in the dose to 15-40 mg/day, made it possible to stop
   exacerbations. Annually, she underwent planned inpatient treatment for the underlying disease, where
  the dose of the drugs taken was adjusted. The last exacerbation of the disease was noted in September
   2008. In the day hospital regime, the following treatment was carried out: regimen, diet, intravenous
  injection: pulse therapy "Solu-medrol" 1000 mg (18.09.08 and 19.09.2008), asparkam, cardionat,
  cytoflavin and Riboxin No. 5, Neoton 4g No. 2, Vitamins: C, B1, Trental No. 3, Cerebrolysis No. 1,
  Piracetam No. 3, Prednisolone 40 mg in the morning, Methotrexate 10 mg / week. After the therapy, a
  short-term improvement in well-being was noted, however, from mid-October, the condition
  progressively worsened in the form of discomfort behind the sternum with irradiation to the left arm
  and shortness of breath with little physical exertion (rise to the 1st floor), palpitations, heartburn, sour
  belching, nausea , pain in the shoulder, knee, ankle, small joints of the hands, feet, swelling of the face
  in the morning, general weakness, internal discomfort and itching of the skin of the face, forearms,
  hands, as well as a feeling of lack of air mainly at night, hyperemia back and wings of the nose.
  Increasing the dose of methotrexate taken up to 15 mg/week and prednisolone up to 40 mg/day did
  not lead to the desired result. The existing complaints, despite the intake of omeprazole and almagel
  for the purpose of gastroprotection, were joined by pain in the epigastric region, heartburn, sour
  belching, nausea, episodic vomiting after taking medications, progressively increasing general weakness, n

  logical department in a planned manner.
   Over the past two years, he has noted an increase in blood pressure up to 170/110 mm Hg, accompanied by
  given by dizziness, nausea, palpitations. Takes antihypertensive drugs regularly
   oliprel 2mg in the morning). For the first time, systolic murmur over the apex of the heart appeared in 2006,
  with time its intensity increased. Episodic pain in the epigastric region notes for ten years, was treated
  independently with a temporary positive effect. Over the past two years, sh
   stiffness when walking, numbness in the fingers of the upper limbs, not treated, no medical help

    greeted.

   Around 5:00 on November 17, 2008. I woke up with an unbearable headache and nausea. There was a single vomiting
  food eaten the day before. Given the increase in blood pressure to 170/100 mm Hg. self-administered captopri

   Technical commentary on the study 11/15/2006: Antibodies to the
   common extractable nuclear antigen of antibodies to SS-A antigen 60 kDa were found Antit
   ate to Ro / SS-A antigen with a mass of 60 kDa are relatively more often detected in patients with SLE than in patients with III syndrome
   ogren and skin forms. Antibodies to the 60 kDa Ro/SS-A antigen are relatively more frequently detected in more
   ny SLE than in Sjogren's syndrome and cutaneous primary skin lesions, secondary dry syndrome, photosensitivity and articular
   syndrome. A dangerous manifestation of SLE associated with ant
   antibodies against Ro / SS-A 60 kDa, is a syndrome of congenital lupus that develops in newborns
    from women in labor with SLE. The basis of this disease is the penetration into the blood of a newborn
   placenta anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies. The main manifestation of congenital lupus is dermatosis and lesions.

        History of present illness. Suffering from coronary heart disease, hypertension for a long time

   chesky disease. In 2006, she suffered a massive myocardial infarction. 10/17/2010 completed promptly
   e treatment for bleeding (shock 2-3) from a chronic stomach ulcer. During the same hospitalization, decompensated
   diabetes mellitus was revealed. After discharge, she did not follow the doctor's recommendations, she became

   kind, where complex treatment with active diuretic therapy was performed. The last hospitalization in the pulmonology
   department of City Hospital No. 26. After being discharged from the hospital on December 14, 2010, she began to notice a sharp
   shortness of breath at rest, the appearance of a cough without discharge, an increase in general weakness. December 23, 2010 sta
   admitted to the hospital therapy clinic. Feeling good for 2 weeks after being discharged,
    however, in the future, there is a progressive increase in the feeling of weakness, shortness of breath, which requires repea
   oh hospitalization. In February, March and April 2011, for the reasons described above, it took place permanently
   e treatment, where punctures of the pleural cavity and evacuation of the contents were performed. In June 20011, the state

   was hospitalized in order to exclude a neoplasm (mesothelioma) at the Federal State Institution "Research Institute of Oncology named after N.N. N.N. Pe

    ova" of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, where, after a comprehensive examination, including a biopsy of the pleu

   s and thoracoscopy data for the neoplasm is not received. Diagnosed with idiopathic right-sided
   and hydrothorax, ischemic cardiomyopathy. Subsequently, she underwent inpatient treatment at the Regional
   Cardiological Dispensary of the Leningrad Region. After discharge, for 2 months I felt
   I satisfactorily, however, in the future, due to progressive weakness on an outpatient basis, every
   at least 2,000 ml of fluid was evacuated monthly during punctures of the right pleural cavity. During
    hospitalization in March 2012 during the drainage of the pleural cavity in the period from 5 to 8 March
   about 6000 ml of hemorrhagic exudate was recovered, a drop in hemoglobin level from 144 to 80 g/l was noted, which
   served as a reason for transfer to a surgical hospital, where data for ongoing intrapleural
   no bleeding was obtained, she received conservative therapy, therapy with terilitin. Discharged with subfebrile fever.
   Due to the deterioration of health in May 2012 in the form of severe fever
   and, pain in the right half of the chest, was hospitalized in the hospital surgery clinic, where


  she received inpatient treatment for pleural empyema on the right. After discharge, she felt relatively
  well. October 2012 general weakness began to progressively increase again, the tolerance to physical
  activity sharply decreased, and the stomach increased in volume. She underwent inpatient treatment
  at the hospital therapy clinic with a positive effect. During the year, there was a slow progression of
  ascitic phenomena, which by November 2013. acquired a pronounced decompensated character and
  required another hospitalization. She was hospitalized by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic
   for further diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis at discharge: "Chronic viral hepatitis B, cirrhotic stage
  (Child-Pugh class B). Fibrosis of the liver of mixed (cardiac, dysmetabolic) genesis. Chronic
  hepatocellular insufficiency of the 1st stage, compensation. Portal hypertension syndrome, ascites.

   encephalopathy of the second stage of mixed (hypertonic, atherosclerotic, dysmetabolic) genesis.
  Degenerative-dystrophic disease of the spine. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, target HbAc<8.0%." During
  hospitalization, there was a pronounced tolerance to the ongoing complex diuretic therapy in high
  doses. After discharge from the hospital, she was under dispensary dynamic supervision of a polyclinic
  doctor at her place of residence, she did not take the recommended therapy. There was a progressive
  increase in body weight, during the last month there was a pronounced general weakness, an increase
  in the volume of the abdomen, shortness of breath of a mixed, mainly inspiratory, nature with
   previously tolerated exercise tolerance. Considering these circumstances, the patient went to the
  polyclinic at the place of residence, was hospitalized in a planned manner according to the compulsory
  medical insurance system to the hospital therapy clinic for diagnosing the condition and selecting
   adequate therapy for the outpatient stage. Past diseases, injuries, contusions, operations: myocardial

   ofenak-retard, prednisolone 30 mg/day) against which there was a significant improvement in well-being. She underwent
   inpatient treatment at military unit 25515 with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, seropositive, articular
   i form. Received cytostatic therapy, mini-pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, movalis
   , physiotherapy with a positive effect. In the future, against the background of outpatient cytostatic
   th therapy (methotrexate 7.5 mg/week, prednisone 10 mg/day), pain appeared, heaviness in the epigastrium, left and right
   right hypochondrium, in connection with which in May 2006 she independently refused to take medication

   hands, rhythmic, with a frequency of 158 beats. per minute, weak filling, uniform, low tension, palpi
  the vascular wall is cut outside the pulse wave. The monitor registers supraventricular tachycardia with a heart
  rate of 158/min. SatO2=92%. Blood pressure: on the right shoulder - 80/60, on the left shoulder - 80/60 mm Hg. with
   m. Limits of relative cardiac dullness: right and upper are normal; left - on the left mid-clavicular
   line. The heart sounds are muffled, the 1st tone is weakened above the apex of the heart, the systolic murmur is at the apex.

        Complaints at admission: moderate weakness, sweating, thirst, dry mouth, shortness of breath and disco
   comfort in the left half of the chest with moderate physical exertion, periodically headaches mainly in the
   occipital region, weight gain.

       Anamnesis of the disease: in 2006, during a hospital examination and treatment, sugar was detected for the first tim
   type 2 diabetes. Glucometer measures blood sugar levels on its own when absolutely necessary
   om Aku Chek. The patient has been suffering from coronary heart disease and hypertension for a long time
   since 2000. He was repeatedly hospitalized in various clinics of the Military Medical Academy. Last hospital
   admission to the HT clinic was from 18.01. to 03.02.2010. Antihypertensive and hypoglycemic drugs
   nothing. Over the past year, there has been an increase in blood pressure rises, an increase in the severity of headache

       whether.

       Present deterioration: during the last week notes an increase in blood glucose levels up to 20 mm
   ol/l (measured independently). In this connection, he turned to the HT clinic and was hospitalized.

       Objective status at admission: general condition of moderate severity, due to decompensation
   diabetes mellitus, a manifestation of which is diabetic ketosis. Hypersthenic constitution

   the edge of the costal arch, effleurage along the lumbar region is painless on both sides.

       The following treatment was carried out: parenterally: glucose (5%-200 ml/day), MgSO4 (25%-5 ml/day), KCl (5
   % -30 ml / day), Humulin (12 U / day). Inside: aspirin 100 mg/day, galvusmet 150/1500 mg/day, enalapril 5 m
   g / day, verapamil 120 mg /

       day. As a result of the treatment, the state of health improved, blood glucose was within acceptable limits.

   onary arteries, CHF 1 fc, chronic calculous cholecystitis, remission, thoracic osteochondrosis
   la with muscular-tonic syndrome, obesity of the third degree. Regularly takes amlodipine, Valsart
   an + hypothiazide, plavix with a positive effect.

         Over the past year, I began to notice the frequent appearance of discomfort in the lower part of the chest on both sides.

    nausea, vomiting of bile with episodes of streaks of blood in it, general weakness began to increase. October 18 20
   13 years after physical exertion (6-hour service), a sharp weakness developed, darkening in the eyes with
   subsequent short-term loss of consciousness. As he fell, he hit the corner of the table with his spatula. After the data
   th episode, significant weakness appeared, cough with bloody discharge (during the last

        History of present illness. She suffered from chronic bronchitis for a long time. fell ill in 2011
   the disease acquired a protracted course with frequent bouts of dyspnea, which required active treatment for
  medical help. Bronchial asthma was verified on a stationary basis, adequate therapy was selected for outpatient
   admission (Seretide-multidisc 50/250 1 dose 1 time per day and berodual 2 doses 2 times a day). AT
   the same year she was operated on for urolithiasis on both sides, the stones were removed. In after

   during the operating period, she began to notice a significant increase in blood pressure, mainly

   due to diastolic, palpitations, weakness, weight began to progressively increase (during the last 2 years, body
  weight has been stable). Takes diltiazem without visible effect.

       As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 7, Seretide-multidisc, Berodual, Acecardol, Amlod
  ipin, omeprazole, furosemide, ciprofloxacin, the state of health has improved.

        The patient was consulted by Professor Barsukov A.V. It was determined that at present the course of
   concomitant diseases is of the maximum possible compensated character. The severity of the condition
  I and the prognosis determine the functional state of the excretory function of the kidneys and the existing neoplasm
  adrenal glands, which make a significant contribution to the maintenance of arterial hypertension,
   sheniya heart rhythm, the defeat of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Despite the convincing effect of the prescribed

      History of present illness. Since childhood, he often suffered from tonsillitis. In 1985, he was diagnosed with

   onic tonsillitis, for which he was treated on an outpatient and inpatient basis. In 1995, after moving
   ny angina developed infectious-allergic myocarditis, which proceeded with severe violations of the heart rhythm and
   conduction. Subsequently, myocardial cardiosclerosis was formed with impaired
   conduction in the form of a complete blockade of the right leg of the bundle of His, blockade of the anterior branch of the left leg
   and bundle of His. In the future, he was repeatedly treated for this in a hospital. Since 1999 worries about odes
   The scale during physical activity, during a stationary examination, heart failure of the first functional class was verified.
   Since 2000, they have been worried about interruptions in the work of the heart, frequent ventricular
   new extrasystole. Since 2004, they began to worry about pressing pains behind the sternum during physical exertion, st

   dii, stopped by electropulse therapy. In December 2008, coronary angiography was performed, with which
   a swarm of angiographic signs of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries was not revealed. April
   le 2009 in a hospital while performing an endocardial electrophysiological study of the heart
   and sustained paroxysms of ventricular tachycardia were induced from the outflow tract of the right ventricle
   daughter. In this regard, on April 15, 2009, a cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted. In the future, patients

   The patient continues to be disturbed by pressing pains behind the sternum and shortness of breath during physical exertion, interruptions in w
   those hearts. As a result, he was repeatedly hospitalized. Headache on the background of episodes of increased art
   serial pressure up to 150/100 mm Hg. Art. worried since 1986. Since 1995, he has been observed for neuroc
   circulatory asthenia of the hypertensive type, occasionally took antihypertensive drugs with
   powerful effect. Since 2004, an increase in blood pressure to 150/100 mm Hg. Art. takes a stand

   008, against the background of constant intake of antihypertensive drugs, there are rises in blood pressure
   up to 160/100 mm Hg. Art., permanently diagnosed with hypertension of the second stage, the initial manifestation of
   cerebrovascular insufficiency. In September 2011, he underwent hypertensive cr

   about impaired glucose tolerance. In 2003, during a hospital examination, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a mild
   course, was established. Until 2008, compensation was achieved by diet. Since 2008, hypoglycemic drugs have been
   added to the diet. Currently taking Glibomet. Against this background, diabetes is compensated. In April 2009, d

hepatosis. A disability certificate was not issued. Employability has not been restored. Clinical outcome (underline):
improvement Outcome: discharged due to improvement Admission: Complaints: pressing pain in the heart area

during exercise; shortness of breath of an inspiratory nature; with

ear cough without phlegm; an increase in body temperature up to 39 degrees; weakness.
     Anamnesis of the disease: He considers himself ill since the beginning of March 2011, when, against the background of hy

these complaints were received. He did not seek medical help, periodically took Biseptol, Amox

   icillin. In connection with persistent complaints, he sought medical help at the clinic on 03/17/20
   11, ECG revealed atrial fibrillation, radiograph focal pneumonia. hospitalized
    by ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic.
         Objective status: general condition is severe, no edema, heart rate 76 per minute, rhythmic, auscultatory t

   The heart sounds are muffled, the accent of the second tone is above the aorta, the borders of the heart are expanded to the left, BP is 110/70 mm

   t.st., hard breathing in the lungs, no wheezing; the abdomen is soft, painless on palpation, effleurage
    in the lumbar region painlessly on both sides. As a result of

        the treatment: mode III, diet No. 10, antibiotic therapy (Ceftriaxone 1.0 2 r / day), polarizing mixture (glucose 5%,
   potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate., Vit. C 6 ml - No. 5), metabolic
   anti-inflammatory therapy (Mildronate), antisecretory therapy (omeprazole), anti-inflammatory therapy (Ibuprofe
   n 0.4 3 r / day), GCS therapy (Prednisolone IV 90 mg 3 r / d), antiarrhythmic therapy (Cordaron 0.2 3 r / d)
   , anticoagulant therapy (Heparin s / c at 2500 4 r / d) the state of health improved in the form of a decrease in shortness of breath
   and, the degree of severity in the region of the heart, the divergence of the sheets of the pericardium decreased.

   the content of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, creatinine, potassium, urea, glucose. 59.
   Determination of blood levels of T3, T4, antibodies to thyroglobulin, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone - 2
  times a year, followed by correction based on the results of a dose of levothyroxine 60. Continuous monitoring
   of body weight !!! with an increase in body weight of more than 1 kg (in comparison with data in
   discharges) consultation of a cardiologist in order to exclude the worsening of the course of chronic heart failure
   accuracy and correction (if necessary) of the therapy. 61. Diet:
   restriction of protein intake with food to up to 0.8-1 g / kg (up to 50-60 g per day), depending on you
  severity of renal failure. At the same time, 30 g should be a highly valuable protein, and the share of chl

   Eba, cereals, potatoes and other vegetables should account for only 10 g of protein per day. 30-40 g of complete protein

Last week, she began to notice an increase in dyspnea, its occurrence at rest. In this connection, she was taken by an

ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications Objective status: general condition of moderate severity,

swelling of the feet, legs, heart rate 90 per minute, deficiency

it is not, the pulse is rhythmic, auscultatory heart sounds are muffled, the 1st tone is weakened above the apex of the

heart, there is a coarse systolic murmur at the apex, the borders of the heart are expanded, blood pressure is 110/60 mm

       Taking into account the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy
   apia and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, as well as given the unilateral effusion (right
  pleural cavity), further diagnosis should still exclude a neoplasm
  diagnostic (pleural
       mesothelioma?) Performing diagnostic videothoracoscopy was inappropriate for the patient, since this ma

       This block includes a number of mental disorders grouped together in relation to the presence of
  other etiological factors, namely, the cause of these disorders were brain diseases, injuries
  a brain or stroke leading to cerebral dysfunction. Dysfunction may be primary (to
  as in diseases, brain injuries and strokes that directly or selectively affect the head
  brain) and secondary (as in systemic diseases or disorders where the brain is involved
  I am in the pathological process along with other organs and systems).

       Dementia [dementia] (F00-F03) is a syndrome caused by damage to the brain (usually chronic
  of a progressive or progressive nature), in which many higher cortical functions are disturbed, including
  including memory thinking, orientation, understanding, counting, learning ability, speech and judgment. conscious
  it's not darkened. Decreased cognitive function is usually accompanied, and sometimes preceded, by worsen
  lack of control over emotions, social behavior or motivation. This syndrome is observed in diseases
  and Alzheimer's, in cerebrovascular diseases and in other conditions, primary or secondary lesions
  brain.

       If necessary, an additional code is used to identify the underlying disease.

  CASE HISTORY y
  Surname, name, patronymic
  born in 1960 She was on inpatient treatment in the clinic of hospital
  therapy. Total days of treatment were 15. The final diagnosis was
  established. Diagnosis: Primary: Ischemic heart diseasIeC.DPCroogdresIs2i0v.e0

       angina from 06/14/2011 (unstable stenocardia

  nocardia IA according to E. Braunwald) with stabilization at the level of functional class II from 06/17/2011. Athero
  lerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries. Atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis. Hypertension stage III
  and, arterial hypertension of the II degree with stabilization at the level of normal blood pressure, the risk
  of CCO 4. Vitamin B12-folate deficiency anemia of severe degree. Complications of the underlying disease:

       CHF stage IIA, II f.c. Concomitant diseases: Bronchial asthma, mixed form (atopic, primary altered
       bronchial reactivity), moderate severity, unstable remission. AD 1. Urinary tract infection

  uh, exacerbation. Left kidney cyst. CKD stage I (GFR 94.1 ml/min/1.73 m2). CRF 0. Obesity 1 degree, and
  android type, stable stage. cerebrovascular disease. Acute cerebrovascular accident
  from 2008. Myoma of the right scapular region. Varicose disease. Varicose veins n
  lower limbs. CVI stage I. Certificate
  of incapacity for work was not issued
  Clinical outcome: improvement Outcome:
  discharged due to improvement

  On admission:
  Complaints: dull pressing pain behind the sternum, radiating to the left arm, left shoulder blade, stopping with
  eating nitroglycerin; shortness of breath with minimal exertion, accompanied by an increase in bullets
  sa; fast fatigue with minimal physical exertion; feeling of heaviness in the limbs; asthma attacks that occur
  spontaneously about 1 time per day, stopped by taking salbutamol; leg swelling

            .

   Anamnesis of the disease: considers himself ill for about 2 years, when there was a slight shortness of breath during physical
   th load, stress. She did not go to the doctors about this, she was not treated, she considered shortness of breath a manifestation o
   onchial asthma, used salbutamol with a positive effect. In March 2011, she suffered from acute respiratory infections,
   after which she suffered from acute thrombophlebitis of the right leg, both diseases were accompanied by fever.
   oh, expressed intoxication syndrome, received antibiotic therapy. In May 2011, shortness of breath
   progressed, weakness in the limbs with minimal physical exertion (walking less than 100 meters, climbing stairs 1 flight).
   From the age of 17 he suffers from bronchial asthma. Asphyxiation occurs
   t for contact with animal hair, occupational hazards (substances of dental practice). At 24, at 30, asthmatic status. She did
   not receive glucocorticoid or combination therapy. She currently takes salbutamol on demand (about once a day). Note
   that with age
   the attacks of suffocation are less frequent. In 2008, she suffered an ischemic stroke (according to words), after which she remai
   dual phenomena in the form of a violation of writing. The neuropathologist is not observed. Before brain damage
   I considered the working pressure to be 130/80 mm Hg. periodically there were rises in blood pressure up to 160/100 mm Hg
   .st. Therapy was prescribed: Renitek, ThromboASS. Over the past two months, there has been a decrease in A
   D up to 110 / 70-60 mm Hg, independently stopped taking Renitek, however, the pressure is kept at the level
   e 110/70 mm Hg (the words). On June 14, 2011, she felt a deterioration in the form of pressure
   her pain behind the sternum, which radiated to the left arm, left shoulder blade, was stopped by taking nitrogli
   cerin. In connection with the strengthening of the listed complaints, the progression of pain cardiac syndrome for 2 days,
   according to urgent indications, she was hospitalized in the clinic of GT of the Military Medical Academy.
        Objective status: general condition of moderate severity, swelling of the legs, ankles, on palpation
    radial arteries, the pulse is the same on both hands, rhythmic, 88 beats per minute. Arterial pressure
   IE: 140/80 mmHg Art. Borders of relative cardiac dullness: right - along the right edge of the sternum; upper
   i - on the third rib; left - on the left mid-clavicular line; on auscultation, the heart sounds are muffled;

    hard breathing in the lungs, single scattered wheezing in the lower parts of the lungs; belly soft

   th, painless on palpation; tapping on the lumbar region is painful on both sides. As a result of the treatment:
   regimen, diet, metabolic therapy (polarizing mixture: Sol.Gluco
   sae 5% -200 ml, Sol.Asparcami 20ml, Sol.Insulini 4Ed), anticoagulant therapy (Heparin 20t.Ed / day), ointment
   and platelet therapy (Acecardol 0.1 per day), antihypertensive therapy (Perindopril 0.01 per day), preventive
   overt antiarrhythmic therapy (Verapamil 0.24 per day), antiplatelet therapy (Acecardol 0.1 per day), mucolytic therapy
   (Lazolvan 2 ml / day through a nebulizer), glucocorticoids (Dexamethasone according to the scheme with
    gradual reduction and withdrawal), vitamin therapy (B12 1000 mcg / day / m, folic acid 6 mg / day
   ki) health improved, cardiac pain syndrome does not bother, tolerance to physical stress
   increased, weakness in the limbs is much less pronounced, occurs on a greater load, than
   m before hospitalization, blood pressure is stabilized at the level of normal, there is a tendency to normalize he
   mograms.
    After relief of cardiac pain syndrome and stabilization of angina pectoris at the level of II f.k. on the first
   The first plan was a severe anemic syndrome. Considered B12 deficiency anemia, iron deficiency
   i anemia, autoimmune nature of the lesion, as well as a mixed variant. The patient was consulted
   an atologist, a survey was conducted in the direction of finding out the cause of anemia. It was established that at the
   moment there is no need for blood transfusion, blood loss did not occur acutely. Aspiration bi
   bone marrow opsia, blood test for vitamin B12, folic acid. It appears that hemolysis, recognized
   which are found in the biochemical analysis of blood, is due to the decay of macro- and megalocytes in the village
   Esenka and microvasculature, which fits into the framework of B12-folic deficiency anemia. Apparently n
   and at the prehospital stage, the patient received vitamins of group B, which is the reason for reticulocytosis during fasting.

   intoxication. Complete blockade of the left bundle branch block has been taking place since 2008. Against this
   background, when performing a planned load, an increase in ST segment depression up to 4.0 mm is recorded, which
   can be regarded as a circulatory disorder. Given the data of a clinical blood test (the size of erythrocytes is significantly increase
   , it can be argued that the phenomena of circulatory disorders are leveled after the restoration of normal
   oh picture of the hemogram.

         Consulted by a surgeon about a subcutaneous mass in the area of the angle of the right scapula: preliminary
   positive diagnosis: myoma of the right scapular region; targeted radiography of the right lobe is recommended.
   treacle area in two projections. On sighting radiographs of the right scapula in two projections of the bones
   no changes were found.


   Results of instrumental studies:

   ECG from 06/16/2011: sinus rhythm. The horizontal position of the EOS. Complete blockade of the left leg of the bundle G
   isa. Cicatricial changes in the anterior septal region are not excluded. Hypertrophy of the left heart

   X-ray of the chest organs from 06/17/2011: the pulmonary fields are moderately emphysematous. Pulmonary
    the pattern in the middle and lower sections on both sides is reinforced and deformed due to pneumofibrosis. The
   roots of the lungs are structural, not expanded. The sinuses are free. The median shadow is not expanded. FVD from
   05/24/2011: violation of FVL for obstructive type I degree. The test with Berotek is positive. Ultrasound of OMT from
   06/22/2011: the uterus is in anteflexio, not enlarged, the ovaries are not located. Gas in the rectum (g
   prepared for RRS), examination is
   difficult. Myelogram dated 06/20/2011: bone marrow cell punctate. Erythroid sprout hyperplastic,
    megaloblastic. Of 57.4% of erythrokaryocytes, 19.2% are megaloblasts. Leukoerythroblastic ratio
   e 1.3. Attention is drawn to a sharp increase in basophilic erythrokaryocytes, and in the preparations of peripheral
   and blood reticulocytosis up to 40%. megalocytes have Jolly bodies, Cabot rings, basophilic puncture
   and I. The granulocytic germ is narrowed, there are gigantic forms from myelocytes to p / neutrophils, polysegment
   mentation of neutrophil nuclei. Megalocytic sprout within hematological reference values: platelets lace, 38%

   daughter septum. Global contractility is preserved. Diastolic dysfunction by t
   type of delayed relaxation. Mitral insufficiency I degree. The pericardium is not changed. Holter
   monitoring from 07/01/2011: sinus rhythm with emergency was recorded during the observation
   From 60 to 110 per minute. The decrease in heart rate at night is insufficient. Average heart rate 79/83/72 per minute. registra
   The following rhythm and conduction disturbances were identified: single monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles
   s (total 3); single polytopic supraventricular extrasystoles (38 in total). When performing the planned load in the form
   of climbing stairs, the heart rate reached 106 and 110 per minute (submaximal heart rate did not reach
   ta), noted fatigue in the legs. Against the background of the initial depression of the ST segment up to 2 mm, due to
   the complete blockade of the left leg of the bundle of His, during the execution of the planned load, an increase in dep
   ression of the ST segment up to 4.0 mm, which can be regarded as a circulatory disorder.

History of the disease: According to the submitted medical documentation, since 1982 he has been

suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (with VVC, fasting hyperglycemia of 8.0 mmol/l was detected).

Regularly followed the diet and the prescribed treatment, the blood sugar level did not exceed 8 mmol/l.

Coronary heart disease for more than 20 years, was repeatedly treated in a hospital. During the last 3 years,

exertional angina was noted at the level of 2-3 functional class. Took cardio during seizures

        Anamnesis of the disease: Patient considers himself since 2008, when 3 weeks after the transferred lacunar
   angina for the first time developed a paroxysm of atrial fibrillation, complicated by the development of pulmonary edema.
    A military hospital was hospitalized, where acute infectious-immune myocarditis was diagnosed,
    carried out complex treatment. After discharge, the patient noted frequent attacks of palpitations (1-2 times a week),
   accompanied by severe general weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness. In view of this, in
   From 2008 to 2012, he was repeatedly hospitalized in various hospitals in St. Petersburg with par
   oxysms of atrial fibrillation (AF). The disease was complicated twice by the development of cardiogenic aritis.

   CONSULTATIONS CARRIED OUT:
   Gastroenterologist - I agree with the diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis. Recommendations for correction of therapy are
   given. THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT: Transfusions: 03.06.2016 albumin 10% - 4 doses, 06/03/2016 erythrocyte mass - 2 doses
   06/06/2016. fresh frozen plasma - 2 doses 10.06.2016 albumin 10% - 4 doses 15.06.2016 albumin 10% - 2 doses

   SURGICAL TREATMENT: Fluid

   AT DISCHARGE: Patient with extremely high cardiovascular, arrhythmogenic and hemorrhagic risk. With
   the degree and severity of damage to the heart muscle does not determine the severity of the condition. Dominant
   the pathology of the liver is manifested by the development of cirrhosis, hepatosplenomegaly and severe hypoprotein
   inemia, which contributes to the development of significant edema, disruption of the coagulation link, the threat of developing tr
   ombo-hemorrhagic syndrome. The development of cirrhosis in a patient is indicated not only by structural changes
   liver disease, dilatation of the veins of the portal system, detected by ultrasound, but also a significant decrease in protein
   ovosynthetic function, a decrease in the level of calcium and magnesium in blood plasma. Given the nature and extent of
   myocardial changes, the contribution of cardiac dysfunction to the development of cirrhosis is minimal, which allows
   t is currently considered to be cryptogenic cirrhosis, and considering 10 points on the Child-Pugh scale, one can cons
   tat the decompensation of the course of cirrhosis without signs of portal hypertension (performed FGDS, in
   ultatation of which no data on the presence of varicose veins of the esophagus were obtained). Therefore, qi
   Rroz of the liver is currently the main contribution to the severity of the condition of the patient with the disease. Neoplastic
   process has not been proven. The results of the study of oncomarkers with positive
   m result and an increase of more than two times Gl 19-9 Ag (86.8 U / l), possibly determined by the presence of liver damage.
   The main efforts are focused on the normalization of the electrolyte and protein composition of the blood,

   thunderstorms of thrombo-hemorrhagic syndrome, decrease in the severity of tissue hyperhydration, hepatoprotection
   ivy therapy.

   RECOMMENDED: Observe the regime of work and rest.

   quite satisfactory, but at the end of 2015. colon cancer diagnosed

   o since April of this year, she began to experience difficulty in walking, muscle weakness, and since May 2016. more difficult
   difficulty in maintaining the head in a vertical position, then shortness of breath began to disturb, 25.05.2016
   CT examination of the chest and abdomen: thrombosis of the branches of the right and left pulmonary arteries
   I, portal vein thrombosis. May 26, 2016 She was hospitalized at the Propaedeutics Clinic for Internal Diseases, treated
   with Clexane and Eliquis, and was discharged on 10.06.2016. Due to deteriorating health
   Viya during the last days in the form of increasing shortness of breath, especially at night, turned to the CD today
   Center of the Medical Academy, where cardiac asthma, PE were suspected. Patient with a medical emergency
   Yam is directed to hospitalization to the hospital therapy clinic.
        Upon admission, the condition was regarded as severe, due to increasing respiratory symptoms.
   oh failure. When performing angio-CT data for PE was not received. During the first days of
   IVL was performed (NIV, support pressure 15 cm w.c. FiO2 30%), however, on the night of June 17-18
    developed loss of consciousness, accompanied by tachycardia, the development of hypotension, tachypnea, clonic
    convulsions. The patient was transferred to a ventilator. During this period, the dynamics of transmural damage on the ECG
    in the region of the lower wall with the transition to the side wall, top. By the time of development, these changes
   I coincided with the time of impaired consciousness and developed against the background of relatively stable hemodynamic
   no signs of arrhythmias. Considering the increase in CPK (total), CPK-MB (these changes are noted
   within the last 2 weeks), a 3-fold increase in troponin levels. When performing MRI of the head, data on stroke were
   not obtained. Coronary angiography revealed multiple stenosing
   its defeat of the coronary bed with a pronounced collateral network. Signs of acute plaque ulceration
    not received.
        The severity of the condition is due to the development of severe pulmonary heart failure, mutual potency
   teasing each other. Dominant in the clinical picture were ventilation disorders,
   ed only with the use of a ventilator. Their genesis, most likely, is of a mixed nature: due to m
   knife courses of polychemotherapy, recurrent attacks of thromboembolism developed muscle
    weakness, which does not allow the patient to independently carry out a full breath, diffuse pneumofib
   roses with the development of pronounced restrictive changes (which manifests itself, among other things, in a significant incre
   compliance of the lungs) and a decrease in the respiratory surface, as well as the presence of acute cardiovascular
   oh insufficiency, which aggravates the process of gas exchange in the alveoli, requiring constant maintenance of
   positive end-expiratory pressure. Damage to the heart is diffuse in nature with predominantly
   th damage to the lower wall. This damage contributes to some decrease in systolic function, however, in the
   development of heart failure, diastolic disorders after
   effect of fibrosis of the heart muscle.
        During June 18-21, the patient received mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Further after the ext
   ubation was systematically transferred to VVL, insufflation with oxygen flow. Currently reached max
   the least possible compensation for pulmonary heart failure. The optimal therapy has been selected - but
   rmotension, respiratory rate less than 22/min, SaO2 when breathing atmospheric air 95-98%. Infrequent cr
   short-term episodes of acute respiratory failure well controlled by insufflation with a flow of ki
   sloroda.

   The degree of damage to the heart muscle determines the severity of the condition in part. Patolo is dominant
   liver disease, manifested by the development of cirrhosis, hepatosplenomegaly and severe hypoproteinemia, which with
   contributes to the development of extremely severe edema, disruption of the coagulation link, the threat of developing thrombo-hemorrho
   ragic syndrome. The development of cirrhosis in a patient is indicated not only by structural changes in the liver
   , expansion of the veins of the portal system, detected by ultrasound, but also a significant decrease in protein-synthetic
   eskoy function, a decrease in the level of calcium and magnesium in blood plasma. Given the nature and extent of myocardial
   changes, the contribution of cardiac dysfunction to the development of cirrhosis is minimal, which allows us to
   its time to consider cirrhosis as cryptogenic, and considering 10 points on the Child-Pugh scale, one can state decompensation
   of the course of cirrhosis without signs of portal hypertension (an EGD was performed, as a result of
   some have not received data on the presence of varicose veins of the esophagus). Therefore, cirrhosis of the liver
    is currently the main contribution to the severity of the disease patient's condition. Neoplastic

   depression up to 2 mm is recorded. Daily monitoring of blood pressure (against the background of therapy) from

         09/01/2010: Mean systolic blood pressure during the day and mean diastolic blood pressure during the day are within
   the normal range, mean systolic blood pressure at night is characteristic of mild labile hypertension. At night, systolic
   blood pressure rises paradoxically (nightpicker), diastolic blood pressure falls insufficiently (nondipper). Variability in
   systolic and d
   diastolic blood pressure during the day is increased, at night the variability of systolic and diastolic
   blood pressure is within the acceptable range. 3 episodes of hypotension of systolic blood pressure up to 94 mm Hg were registe
   t. (time index 6%), and 2 episodes of hypotension in diastolic blood pressure up to 48 mm Hg. (time index 23%). There is
   an increase in the average pulse blood pressure, the magnitude and speed of the morning rise in diastolic blood pressure.

    This block includes a number of mental disorders grouped together in relation to the presence of
other etiological factors, namely, the cause of these disorders were brain diseases, injuries
a brain or stroke leading to cerebral dysfunction. Dysfunction may be primary (to
as in diseases, brain injuries and strokes that directly or selectively affect the head
brain) and secondary (as in systemic diseases or disorders where the brain is involved
I am in the pathological process along with other organs and systems).

    Dementia [dementia] (F00-F03) is a syndrome caused by damage to the brain (usually chronic
of a progressive or progressive nature), in which many higher cortical functions are disturbed, including
including memory thinking, orientation, understanding, counting, learning ability, speech and judgment. conscious
it's not darkened. Decreased cognitive function is usually accompanied, and sometimes preceded, by worsen
lack of control over emotions, social behavior or motivation. This syndrome is observed in diseases
and Alzheimer's, in cerebrovascular diseases and in other conditions, primary or secondary lesions
brain.

    If necessary, an additional code is used to identify the underlying disease.

From August 3 to August 14, she was in the clinic of GT VMedA, where idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was verified.
Chronic subcompensated cor pulmonale. DN 1-2 tbsp. After starting to take methylprednisolone at a dose of 30
mg/day, she noted an increase in exercise tolerance, complete relief of cough. She has been deteriorating since
the end of August 2017, when she noted the appearance of a rare cough, increased dyspnea to the level of rest,
increased dryness in the mouth, the appearance of unmotivated thirst, rapid increase
and general weakness and fatigue. The above circumstances formed the basis for the appeal
for medical help.

     On admission September 06, 2017 complaints of severe general weakness (inability to stand), about
mixed breath at rest, aggravated with minimal physical exertion, moderate
cough with mucopurulent sputum of moderate volume, dry mouth and feeling of thirst, dry skin
skin, periodic swelling of the legs to the lower thirds of the legs.

     The general condition was regarded as severe, due to severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose 47 m
mol/l, urinary ketosis, in arterial blood, metabolic acidosis is compensated by respiratory alkalosis), severe
hypoalbuminemia (23 g/l) and hypoproteinemia (46 g/l), severe peripheral hypoperfusion
tissues against the background of hypovolemia (CVP negative. BP with a tendency to hypotension 90-105 / 50-70 mmHg, tachyka

     Against the background of ongoing therapy on September 11, vomiting appeared with small flakes of hematin, with F
attention was paid to diapedetic bleeding from the surface of the mucous membrane and single small erosions of the
stomach. Considering a significant decrease in hemoglobin to 60 g / l (including against the background of hemodilution due
ion therapy in the previous days in the treatment of hyperglycemia) and hypocoagulation, a transfusion was performed
one-group [A2B (IV) Rh (-) det. Kell (-) det. dCchyy] blood, plasma, albumin.

     During the treatment, stabilization of hemodynamics was achieved at the level of normotension, sinus
th normosystole, subcompensated respiratory failure (when breathing with atmospheric air y SaO2 95-98%),
glycemia compensation (6.0-10.0 mmol / l), kidney function compensated (diuresis adekva
ten of water load without additional stimulation), hypoperfusion and hypovolemia were stopped, the severity of
general weakness was partially reduced. At the control CT of the lungs (on the arms) there are signs of subtotal
al damage by idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis.

     Currently in the further stay in the conditions of the intensive care unit and intensive care
does not need. Further treatment under the supervision of a pulmonologist.


         The patient is shown to continue GCS therapy in the amount of 4.5 tablets of methylprednisolone per day (in the morning
   , under the guise of antacids and secretolytics), oxygen therapy on an ongoing basis through concentrate
   r, breathing exercises with PEEP, nebulizer therapy (berodual 10 drops, ambroxol 20 drops, physio-r 1
    ml - 2 times a day), measures to normalize the nutritional status, support carbohydrate metabolism,
   activization of the patient. A further systematic reduction in the dose of metipred is possible in the regimen of 0.5 tablets per week.
   The use of efferent therapy methods is currently unlikely due to the high risk
   and bleeding, hypoalbuminemia. Inspection of the pulmonologist in dynamics.

   for admission was the appearance on September 28 against the background of the relative well-being of the expressed

   headache without a clear localization against the background of an increase in blood pressure to 170 and 100 mm Hg. Art., which was regarded

   to the "hypertensive crisis" and was the reason for hospitalization in the clinic of hospital therapy of the VMed
   And for urgent reasons. Complaints at admission to severe weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath
   with slight physical exertion, for discomfort behind the sternum that occurs with little physical
   load, pain in the lumbar region, aggravated by a change in body position, dry cough

   COURSE OF THE DISEASE IN THE CLINIC OF HOSPITAL THERAPY:


  On the part of the main organs and systems (cardiovascular, respiratory systems), the patient was
  compensated during the first day, the therapy selected at the previous stages of treatment was
  adjusted within the framework of the underlying and concomitant diseases. Stabilization of
  hemodynamics was confirmed during daily monitoring of ECG and blood pressure. During the
  examination, ultrasound of the abdomen and small pelvis confirmed a polyp of the gallbladder, a
  violation of the rheology of bile, diffuse changes in the pancreas, thickening of the PCS and cysts of
  both kidneys, as well as signs of chronic cystitis, diverticulum (formation?) of the bladder, the
  condition after subtotal resection of prostate adenoma. At the initial X-ray examination, there were no
  signs of hydrothorax, no infiltrative changes were detected. However, CT revealed a picture of
  interstitial changes in the lungs of a congestive nature against the background of COPD (pulmonary
  emphysema, signs of bronchitis, pneumofibrotic changes). Gon's foci, calcified lymph nodes of the
  right bronchopulmonary group, calcifications along the pleura on the right - posttuberculous changes.
  A small amount of fluid in the pleural cavity and pericardial cavity. Degenerative-dystrophic changes
  in the thoracic spine, as well as mixed substitutive hydrocephalus of the brain. In order to clarify the
  nature of changes in the spine due to pain vertebrogenic syndrome, an x-ray examination of the chest
  was performed, which revealed static disturbances in the form of straightening of the physiological
  lordosis and displacement of the bodies L3 posteriorly by 0.7 cm and L5 anteriorly and by 0.9 cm
  (ladder listhesis) . Decrease in body height L1 with its wedge-shaped deformation due to a compression
  fracture. Osteochondrosis L2-3, L3-4, L4-5 motor segments with symptoms of spondylosis. Diffuse
  osteoporosis. In the blood tests, the decrease in the level of protein, urea, and cholesterol was
  explained not only by alimentary causes, but also by a decrease in catabolic processes. From the
  moment of admission, the clinical picture was dominated by pain syndrome caused by ertebrogenic
  pathology (degenerative-dystrophic disease of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Spondyloarthrosis.
  Osteochondrosis of the lumbar spine with L2-L5. Compression uncomplicated stable fracture of the
  L1 vertebral body (of unknown age) with pain and radicular syndromes) against the background of
  neurological deficit. Due to severe pain and radicular syndromes, the patient is constantly in a forced
  horizontal position on the back, which increases the risk of developing vicarious complications:
  congestive pneumonia, thromboembolic catastrophes, soft tissue necrosis, progression of constipation
  events. He was consulted by a neurologist ("Acute lumbodynia, possibly of vertebrogenic origin.
  cerebrovascular disease, stage II encephalopathy with vertebrobasilar insufficiency and moderate
  cognitive impairment") and an orthopedist. The ongoing therapeutic measures, according to the
  principle of reasonableness and sufficiency, were aimed not only at the secondary prevention of life-
  threatening precedents, but also at improving the quality of life. Flupirtine, a non-opioid centrally
  acting analgesic, is used as symptomatic therapy for pain syndrome; it was decided to refrain from
  NSAIDs (taking into account the high risk of nephrotoxicity and bleeding). In addition, the patient was
  examined by the Chief Specialist of the Military Medical Academy for physical therapy, and a course
  of exercise therapy was started. On October 06, 2017, during a planned round of the ward, attention
  was drawn to the patient's drowsiness, does not respond to sound and tactile stimuli, and reacts to
  pain impulses. Due to a sharp increase in neurological deficit, a high risk of developing hypostatic,
  aspiration pneumonia, the need for dynamic monitoring of vital functions, as well as in order to
  eliminate and prevent life-threatening conditions, the patient was transferred to the ICU. In the ICU, the
  neurologist ruled out stroke, diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, which was successfully compensated
  by PK-Merz injections, as well as congestive pneumonia in the basal parts of the lungs. FBS was
  performed (deformation of the lumen of the middle third of the trachea due to external compression,
  deformation of the right main bronchus and left bronchus due to external compression along the
  medial wall, chronic diffuse deforming endobronchitis, exacerbation) were determined. In view of the
  development of nosocomial pneumonia, an analysis of washing water was taken, in which a multidrug-
  resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumanii was identified (06.10.2017). Against
  the background of the treatment, by October 10, a moderate positive effect was achieved in the form
  of achieving the target indicators of the work of internal organs against the background of pronounced age

  Senile lesions of the central nervous system and signs of sarcopenia with the development of muscle
  weakness and age-related dementia remained dominant in the picture of the disease. Patient for
  comprehensive care, regular external monitoring of prescribed medications, prophylaxis

   tics of bedsores and congestion (regular frequent change in body position in bed, percussion
   massage, conducting a course of exercise therapy) was transferred to the cardiology
   department. The course of the disease was characterized by a progressive increase in the phenomena of encephalopathy in the
   nic brain disease of mixed genesis with severe cognitive impairment, hygienic
   proteinemia and hypoalbuminemia, sarco- and dynamopenia, intoxication syndrome, which manifested itself in the form of
   reinforcing the day-night inversion (wakefulness between 15:00-04:00) and signs of dementia, an increase in the
   severity of general weakness, congestion in the basal parts of the lungs, the appearance of subfebrile l
   fever, hemodynamic tendencies to hypotension, decubitus ulcers of the calcaneal areas (the appearance of cyanosis of the
   16.10, examined by a surgeon on 17.10 - "forming bedsores" were verified). As a symptom
   transfusion of two doses of albumin was performed. Changes in urine sediment were associated with the presence
   of an epicystostomy, the toilet of which was performed daily. Despite the relative stability
    patient in general therapeutic terms, high risks of life-threatening nosocomial
   th complications. The combination of a high risk of developing life-threatening thromboembolism (PADUA scale = 7
   points) and an equally low risk of bleeding (H. DECOSUS scale = 12.5 points) predetermined the person
   lysed approach to antithrombotic therapy. Severe cognitive impairment prevented from conducting endoscopic
   studies. Given the extremely high risk of falls (HENDRIK II = 6 points
   c), an individual medical and nursing post was created, the location of the patient as much as possible
   my place from the alarm call button, lowering the height of the bed to the minimum allowable level,
   ruzhenie bed sides. During the entire hospitalization, both the current and the final
   infection.
   However, despite the entire sector of medical and nursing activities, during a planned round of the ward,
    attention to the increasing drowsiness of the patient, does not respond to sound and tactile stimuli, to more
   the left impulse reacts. Due to a sharp increase in neurological deficit, a high risk of developing hypostatic, aspiration
   pneumonia, the need for dynamic monitoring in
   vital functions, as well as in order to eliminate and prevent life-threatening conditions October 18 pa
   The patient was again transferred to the intensive care unit. On admission to
   the ICU, the patient's condition was severe. Consciousness is depressed to the level of a deep stupor, con
   tact with the patient is difficult. The severity of the condition is determined by the increasing phenomena of multiple organ (
   chnoy, cardiac, respiratory, cerebral), predominantly respiratory failure in polymorb

   moment of admission, the condition steadily worsened - the phenomena of respiratory failure increased.
   and, general intoxication, hypoproteinemia and hemostasis disorders. In the washing water of the bronchi, the floor is sown
   and resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia, as well as Acinetobacter baumanii, Enterococcus faecalis, in urine and

   tna) and levofloxacin (susceptible to Acinetobacter baumanii), as well as inhaled Colistin and Dioxidin. As an
   antimycotic therapy - fluoknazol 200 mg / day + bladder lavage. It was determined that hypoproteinemia is of a
   mixed nature. The main contribution is made by heavy protein synthet
   ical dysfunction of the liver (senile and infectious dystrophy and fibrosis in combination with
   radial fibrosis). In addition, there is a high protein catabolism (including gluconeogenesis) in
   conditions of an active immune response against the background of an infectious process, which leads to a rapid breakdown
   excreted albumin/plasma proteins and progressive saturation of the interstitial space with fluid
   with an increase in hypoproteinemic edema. This forms the ineffectiveness of substitution therapy and

  albumin in low doses and increases the concentration of drugs, including antibacterial and antim
   icotic agents in plasma. The use of antibacterial agents in the absence of adequate
   o drainage of the terminal part of the tracheobronchial tree predetermines the extremely low effectiveness of
   antibiotic therapy and forms the resistance of the systemic edematous syndrome and congestive manifestations
   ions in the lungs. Frequent absence of coagulation according to the result of a coagulogram, an increase in subcutaneous hemorrho
   logical manifestations, along with severe hypoproteinemia (low levels of globulins, proteins of the co-
   agulation against the background of liver protein synthesis insufficiency) required correction of the hemostasis system
   The drug of choice in this situation was determined to be fresh frozen plasma as a medium with a wide range of
   plasma proteins and the most suitable option for "prosthetics" of the disorders that take place. Complementary
   but albumin infusions were performed to replenish and normalize oncotic pressure, to bring the
   pharmacodynamics of the administered drugs to the target value. In view of the persistence of fever, a control
   R-gram of the chest was performed on 10/23/2017. on which congestion in the lungs increased. Increased
  amount of fluid in the pleural cavities with a tendency to wasp
   micromanagement. Pneumonic infiltration persists in the lower parts of the lungs. October 24, 2017
   sanation-diagnostic bronchoscopy was completed. Due to the ineffectiveness of antibiotic therapy for
   on the basis of culture data on the sensitivity of microorganisms to antibiotics, ceft was replaced
  rolin to linezolid, inhaled amikacin was prescribed. After
   3 days, despite the change in antibiotic therapy, fever persisted, indicating a
   active infectious process. In the result of sowing wash water, polyresiste was determined
   nt strain of Klebsiella pneumonia (produces metallo-beta-lactamase NMD) with the presence of sensitivity
   and to polyvalent Klebsiella bacteriophage, fosfomycin, colistin, tetracycline, taigecycline.
    In view of the absence of the academy of fosfomycin and bacteriophage in the supply service and pharmacy network, it was decided
   the decision to increase the dose of administered Colistin up to 4 times a day. Given the resistance of the flora to amika
   inu (according to culture), its toxicity, as well as the systemic toxicity of levofloxacin, a decision was made
   stop further use of these drugs. Doses of administered Colistin increased up to 4 times per day
  ducks with its additional introduction intrabronchially when performing fibrobronchoscopy. As part of
   complex antibiotic therapy retained fosfomycin, linezolid, human polyvalent and
   immunoglobulin.
   In addition, the fact of sowing yeast-like fungi of the genus Candida ssp. in sputum and in large quantities in
   urine (urine culture was taken with the determination of sensitivity to antimycotics) indicated the formation of a system
   a lot of mycosis against the background of a systemic immunosuppressive state, and the detection of Candida ssp. after freq
   o flushing of the urinary tract with fluconazole, along with their systemic use at a dose of 200 mg / s
  ut dictated the urgent need to change the antimycotic drug and conduct systemic therapy. The loading dose of
   voriconazole was reduced due to both toxic effects and low albumin levels.
   and excretory function of the kidneys (low creatinine is a reflection of a low rate
   glomerular filtration, but as a result of severe sarcopenia), which creates the prerequisites for a higher
   concentration of the drug in the blood. Additionally, treatment of the exit site to the abdominal wall of the epicystosto
   we are dermazin.
   The change in antibiotic therapy did not affect the course of the disease - in the next three days
  There was fever and respiratory failure, and there was a rapid decrease in the previously administered protein. what t
  required its correction.
   As a result of sowing the wash water, a strain of Klebsiella pneumonia was sown (produces metallo beta-
   lactamase NMD) with sensitivity to the polyvalent Klebsiella bacteriophage, phosph
   omycin, colistin, tetracycline, tigecycline. Due to the ineffectiveness of the ongoing complex antiba
   treatment with all antibiotics available at the VMedA, a decision was made on the vital
   th indications, in view of the direct threat to the life of the patient, to ask the leadership of the academy to purchase tigecycli
   the use of this drug in hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by carbapenemasoproducing
   Klebsiella pneumonia, defined by the National Guidelines (Nosocomial pneumonia in adults

   During a chest x-ray on October 30, 2017. in the horizontal position of the patient in the conditions of the ICU
   without holding the breath, a pronounced negative trend was determined with a significant
   an increase in the amount of encysted fluid, especially on the right and subtotal infiltration of the right l

   mild uneven nature, which does not exclude abscessing. Pleural empyema? Immediately you
  full of CT-chest. Data for the presence of pleural empyema and abscess pneumonia was not received. Revealed
   bilateral middle hydrothorax with compression of the lower lobes of both lungs. The patient was evacuated
  pleural fluid. Against the
  background of initiated therapy with tigecycline, a day later, body temperature returned to normal, decreased
   the severity of respiratory failure. Antibacterial therapy adjusted - introduced
   a Tigecycline (Tygacil 50 mg 2 times a day), inhaled Colistin (4 million units / day) and Dioxidine (80 mg / day
   t).
   In the obtained analysis of urine culture on November 01, the growth of Klebsiella pneumonia was detected. Stated to convin
  no evidence for ongoing urinary and respiratory tract candidiasis, voricon therapy
  terminated with evil. Due to the low level of potassium, its correction was initiated with a constant infusion of 4%
  thief through the
  dispenser. Against the background of ongoing therapy, to date, there has been a positive trend in the form of norma
  function of external respiration, central hemodynamics, stabilization of body temperature, improvement in

   fiery phenomena.

  AT DISCHARGE:
  An elderly patient with symptoms of multiple organ failure. Conducting complex therapy
  I, aimed at achieving stable relief of inflammation in the urinary system and respiratory tract caused by
  Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobater cloacae sensitive to tigecycline (chicken
   completed with antibiotic therapy). Active anti-decubitus measures made it possible to prevent
  prevent the occurrence of new bedsores, and the use of iodine-based drugs significantly improve the condition
   decubitus ulceration of the heel areas.
  In blood tests, signs of respiratory alkalosis are determined, which is predominantly central
  ny genesis (deep breathing without tachypnea, Kussmaul type episodes). Most likely. this is neg
   aggravation of severe metabolic disorders of microcirculation and phenomena of renal insufficiency. During
  sleep, the nature of breathing changes to Grokk, most likely due to severe atherosclerosis of the vascular
  in the brain. Therapy was prescribed to correct the identified disorders. The senile
  lesion of the central nervous system remains dominant in the picture of the disease.
  symptoms of sarcopenia with the development of muscle weakness and immobility, age-related dementia,
   which largely determines the development of complications. The patient needs comprehensive care, regular
  external monitoring of the prescribed medication
  remedies, prevention of bedsores and congestion - regular frequent changes in body position

   while in bed, percussion massage, exercise therapy
